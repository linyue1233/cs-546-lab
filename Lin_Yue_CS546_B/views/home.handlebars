        The webiste designed by Yue Lin is used to search the special character in Marvel, just with html, css and js.
        To connect Marvel Api, I need to create an account and then you will receive two keys. The webiste has three main pages, one of them is home page and searchTerm page for searching similar name,
        and the another is details of a marvel character, where you can see the cool picture! 
    </p>

    <form action="/search" method="post" class="new-post-form">
        <label class="form-label" for="marvelCharacter">searchTerm</label>
        <input id="marvelCharacter" type="text" name="searchTerm" class='marvel-input'>
        <input class="character-input" type="submit" >
    </form>
