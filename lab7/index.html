                Hello, my name is Yue Lin and CWID is 10479231. I come from China, and my hometown is Yangzhou City in
                Jiangsu Province<br />
                And my favorite programming language is Java and C++, I have an intership in a company and at that time
                my title is Java development engineer. My undergraduate major is Computer Science and now I am still
                learning CS, I think it is a good major that makes me feel the beauty of code.<br />
                I have learned Java for about two years, the skills such as Spring Boot, Redis, Message Queue and Spring
                Cloud are very useful in my daily code.<br />
                However, my English is not good enough for me to communicate with others smoothly, I had to spare more
                time to learn English, which is a really tough thing for me.
