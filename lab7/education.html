            <p>
                I have chosen four courses for my first term, and the most difficult and my favorite course is <a
                    style="color: red;">CS-546-B</a>. Because I can learn a lot of new skills such as MongoDB and Async.
                For me, JavaScript is completely unfamiliar language, which has the different grammatical structures and
                data structures.<br />

                In SIT, everything is new for me. There are a lot of things impressing me a lot in my heart. But the
                most memorable thing is that<br />
                last Tuesday, the organization of CSSA which is composed by Chinese held an event for Chinese students,
                they provided free launch and celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

            <h2>Changshu Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>
                This is my undergraduate school, I have learnt about 30 courses in CIT, and my favorite class is <a
                    style="color: red;">Android</a>. Because in that course, our teacher asked us to code most and
                submit a small application by ourselves for the final project.<br />
                Therefore, my programming skills improved a lot in that course, although I forget how to build an
                Android application now.

                To be honset, my undergraduate life was colorful and I still remember the time when I first came to the
                laboratory. My advisor allocated me a task of completing a module of a website with C#.<br />
                But I did not know any knowledge about C#, I had to learn the basic gramm and framework of MVC. The

            </p>
            <aside>
                I was a young boy at that time, so the most memorable memory was express love letters with my
                ex-girlfriend in class. Once, we were caught by the teacher and he asked our parents to come to school.
